# Hi, I'm [Your Name].

### I build digital systems, design experiences, and fix machines.

I am a Developer and Creative Technologist who believes that **engineering is a mindset**, not just a job description. Whether I'm optimizing a Docker container, tuning a D16 engine, or mastering a track, my goal is always the same: precision, performance, and functionality.

### 💻 The Digital Core
My professional focus lies in building robust ecosystems. I specialize in **Mobile (Kotlin)** and **Web (React)** interfaces supported by solid backends in **Java** and **Python**. I don't just write code; I orchestrate it using **Docker** to ensure scalability.

I run my life on **Arch Linux** and **Crdroid**, because I believe in having total control over my environment and understanding the tools I use down to the kernel level.

### 🔧 The Physical & Creative Edge
What sets me apart is that my engineering skills extend beyond the terminal. 

* **Design & 3D:** I bring ideas to life visually using **Blender** for 3D modeling and creating intuitive **UI/UX** identities. I understand that a system must not only work but feel right to the user.
* **Hardware & Mechanics:** I am a hands-on enthusiast. I maintain and modify an old **Honda Civic**, handling everything from the mechanics to the **automotive electrics**. This hobby sharpens my debugging skills—finding a memory leak is surprisingly similar to diagnosing an electrical ground fault.
* **Audio Engineering:** As a music producer, I apply the physics of sound to mixing and mastering. This discipline has taught me the importance of signal flow and fine-tuning, skills I bring back into my code.

### 🗣️ Communication & Horizons
Great code is useless if you can't explain it. I pride myself on my **oratory and social skills**, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical teams and clients. I am fluent in **English** and capable of conversing in **Mandarin**.

When I'm not building or fixing things, I'm studying **Astronomy**. Looking at the macrocosm reminds me to keep a broad perspective on every project I tackle.
